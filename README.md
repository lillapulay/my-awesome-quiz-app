## About
Simple quiz app created with Angular. To be updated soon, as currently it only has very basic functionality. I'm planning to integrate a quiz API and, besides some functional tweaks, give the app consistent syling. 
This project was part of the CF Full-Stack Web Development course. 

### Planned updates:
- [ ] Welcome view: improved component placement
- [ ] Results: show correct answers and questions besides the answer the user has given
- [ ] Question cards: improved display of choices
- [ ] Load quiz data from an API instead of JSON files
- [ ] UI updates (e.g. improvements regarding responsive design, colors)
- [ ] Logo, updated header
- [ ] New favicon
